                    <p><li><em> Sugar</em></li></p>

                <p><em><h1>Instructions</h1></em></p>

                <p><em>First, break the eggs and separate the white from the yolk. There are many techniques to facilitate this process if you are not very skilled with eggs
                    Beat the egg whites using an electric mixer or a hand whisk and reserve the snow whites
                    In another bowl, beat the egg yolks with the cannabic butter and sugar until the mixture is smooth. This process is essential for your cake to be soft and rise, if the sugar is not completely dissolved, it can leave your cake compact and “solid”;
                    Add the milk and mix well until it reaches a uniform texture;
